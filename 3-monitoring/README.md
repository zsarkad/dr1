There are things which must be monitored well

- Resource monitoring (CPU, RAM, Disk)
- Service-Port monitoring (HTTP)
- Network Bandwith Monitoring (Ingress, Egress)



We can use monitoring tools like 
nagios, zabbix --> disk, ram, cpu +
cloudwatch --> for aws environment
prometheus+grafana --> too many things
elk --> log monitoring

We can create alarms from the tools mentioned above and can send them via sms, email, call, slack, teams etc.
